The logic found in the console version of the calculator now serves as the backend for a website! 
Using the Crow framework, I built the RESTful API to make POST requests for our front and backend to communicate.
The backend is written entirely in C++, and is shown in this project.
The frontend is static HTML, CSS, and JS. Due to the simplicity of the current state of the project, there is no need for a frontend framework.

Feel free to download the code for yourself and modify it! Its super basic, but its my first real project handling backends and RESTful API logic so the code may be a bit messy in some places.
